# TDD for MVVM and Databinding
An Android application written in Kotlin built using Test Driven Development (TDD) focusing on MVVM and Databinding using LiveData

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how Android architecture components can be used in conjunction with Test Driven Development (TDD) in order to provide greater test coverage to UI elements without having to rely and automated test scripts such as Espresso.  This is not to imply that we can or should try to replace automated testing scripts completly but rather how leveraging MVVM and Databinding to layout files can reduce the amount of automation tests that need to be written while also increasing test coverage for UI functionality.  

This project assumes you are at least farmiliar with the concepts TDD, MVVM as an Android architecture component, and LiveData.  We will however be walking you through setting up you project and using these concepts in conjunction with each other.  

The end product will be a simple news aggregator but the product itself is simple a means to demonstrate the use of these components.
